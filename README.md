## Licensing

This project is under the GNU v3.0 licensing. If you use **any** code from this project you must do the following:

- Make your project open-sourced (cause open-source=cool)
- Put your project also under GNU v3.0

That's all I ask, as I won't be able to write all of the things in this client either because it's a newer version of Minecraft.
